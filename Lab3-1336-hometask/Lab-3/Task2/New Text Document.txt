For Task 2 I have done These changes in code:
✅ Removes interrupts and instead checks the button state in the loop.
✅ Implements polling (inefficient, CPU keeps checking the button).
✅ Maintains temperature and humidity readings from DHT22 (or DHT11).

Run the same functionality of the lab work without interrupt & log your 
observations. Also state, what happened before and after interrupt?
ANS:It continusely Checks the button state
Delays may miss button press
Less efficent
