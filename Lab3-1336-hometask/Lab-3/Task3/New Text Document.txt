: Understanding Debounce Issue
• What is a debounce issue and why we get rid of it?
ANS:Debounce issue happens when a button presses multiple times due to mechanical bouncing or error.
We can get rid of it we do these changes in code:
1.Import Library utime.
2.Declare a variable(lastpress) in which we will save value of time inital(0).
3.Then in loop if button value=0,adn if if utime.ticks_ms() - last_press > 300 then print "button pressed"
and in lastpress save value of utime
• In which applications/domains, debounce issue can be threatening if not resolved in 
the system?
ANS:It is critical in games controller, keyboards and industrial switches.
• Why debounce occurs? Is it a compiler error, logical error or micro-controller is 
cheap?
ANS:Debounce occurs due to the mechanical nature of physical buttons and switches.
It is not a compiler error or logical error, and it has nothing to do with the microcontroller being cheap.
